## Java-Project-1

Implemented five beginner-friendly Java programs showcasing basic programming concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, loops, and arithmetic operations. Each exercise demonstrates a specific skill:

1. **Basic User Details**:
   - Prompts the user to input their full name, age, and favorite color.
   - Displays a personalized message using the collected inputs.

2. **Simple Arithmetic Calculator**:
   - Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
   - Allows the user to choose an operation: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), or Division (/).
   - Performs the selected operation and displays the result.

3. **Temperature Converter**:
   - Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: `Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 9/5) + 32`.
   - Displays the result in a formatted output.

4. **Grocery Store Bill Calculator**:
   - Asks the user to input the names and prices of three grocery items.
   - Calculates the total cost of the items.
   - Displays the names, prices, and total cost in a structured format.

5. **Multiplication Table Generator**:
   - Prompts the user to input a number.
   - Generates and displays a multiplication table for the given number up to 10 in a formatted table.

These programs highlight the use of basic Java constructs such as `Scanner` for user input, `for` loops, `switch` statements, formatted output with `printf`, and basic arithmetic operations.
